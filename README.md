# Mods
A vast repository for Rift Mods. Make your contribution!

## How do I contribute?
- First off, pick a category your mod fits in. Either be CustomMaps, CustomOutfits, or something else. You are allowed to create new categories.
- Create a folder for your mod and put your .rift file in it, named `mod.rift`.
- Create the metadata files. (`image.png`, `meta.ini`, `readme.md`)
- The image.png will be your thumbnail, the meta.ini file should contain short info about your mod, the readme.md file will be the description that shows in the launcher when you click on a mod.
- If you don't know what any of these 3 files should be, feel free to look at other mods to see what they do.
- Commit your changes and make a pull request. Your mod will be verified and if everything works, it will be approved.
- Ping Noffie in the Rift discord server if your mod doesn't get approved within a day.

When your pull request is approved, your mod should appear in the marketplace within 5 minutes.

For any takedown requests go to the Issues tab and submit one under 'Takedown Requests'

## Rules of submission
- The mod that you upload must be owned by you or you must have permission to upload it by the owner of said mod
- Try your best to fit a mod into the pre-exisiting catagories and if it is really nessacary to create a new one then do so
